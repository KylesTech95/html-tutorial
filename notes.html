ARIA roles
Use ARIA roles.
ARIA roles are values that indicate the function of a page element or region for screen readers. They may be placed inside <div> and <span> tags with the attribute role. ARIA roles include main, form, navigation, and search.

For example, if you want to indicate that the main content represents a main role , you can place an ARIA landmark like so:

<body role=main>
    <div>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
</body>
